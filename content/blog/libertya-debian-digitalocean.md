Recently I got a request to install a test server with Libertya ERP on it so new employees can touch, break and learn. 
The production server was kind of full to host another VM for this purpose, so I decided to use a Digital Ocean dropplet to host the application. 
First, Libertya is an ERP quite popular here in Argentina because of its integration with our Tax Agency. Its installation is not very straight forward, it depends on Java 6, and thats makes the installation on newer systems very messy.

Let's start by creating a Debian Dropplet in Digital Ocean.

I chose the smallest dropplet, as it was only for test purposes. For this server, I selected a Debian 7.0 x64 image.

Once the dropplet is created, you will get your logging credentials on your email. 

After logging sucessfully to the VM, you need to get 4 things: 

+	Postgresql 8.4.
+	JDK 6.
+	ServidorOXP (Libertya Server).
+	DB Dump.

PostgreSQL 8.4
--------------------

Debian 7 comes with PostgreSQL 9.4, this version has some issues with Libertya, so we need to manually install version 8.4 of the DB. For that, we go to [PostgreSQL Debian Download Website](http://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/debian/) and choose from PostgreSQL Apt Repository Wheezy (7.x). It will give us some lines to add to our APT sources. 
So we execute the following commands on our VM:

	:::console
	nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list

And we introduce the following line:

	:::console
	deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ wheezy-pgdg main

We import the repository key, and then do an update. 

	:::console
	wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -
	sudo apt-get update

Finally we install postgreSQL. 

	:::console
	apt-get install postgresql8.4

Once it is up & running, we need to make some changes to postgresql.conf and pg_hba.conf

	:::console
	nano /etc/postgresql/8.4/main/postgresql.conf

we uncomment "listen_addresses = '*'" and save the file. then we edit pg_hba.conf 

	:::console
	nano /etc/postgresql/8.4/main/pg_hba.conf

and we make sure that it is set to trust (we are in a test enviroment)

	:::console
	# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only 
	local all all trust 
	# IPv4 local connections: 
	host all all 127.0.0.1/32 trust 
	host all all 0/0 trust 
	# IPv6 local connections: 
	host all all ::1/128 trust

We reboot the postgreSQL service

	:::console
	service postgresql restart

And it's done. 



Sun JDK 6
--------------------

Installing Sun JDK 6 is kind of messy, the package was removed from Debian Repositories a long time back, and getting installed from the .bin packages is sometimes not very easy. So we are going to do it with the Debian JavaPackage process. 
First we need to add a "contrib" component to our source.list:

	:::console
	deb http://http.debian.net/debian/ wheezy main contrib

We make an update and we install the JavaPackage on our VM

	:::console
	apt-get update && apt-get install java-package && exit

Then we download the latest java6 package. I have [uploaded it](http://nube.datacor.com.ar/public.php?service=files&t=cabddbd4124637697102d09e244cf0ab) to my cloud because is a pain in the a** to register with Oracle, but you can always download it directly from there if you don't trust me (and you shouldn't..).

After we downloaded the .bin file. we create the debian package.

	:::console
	make-jpkg jdk-6u45-linux-x64.bin

It may ask you to not be root in this process, if that is the case, just create a normal user and run the above command without superuser priveleges. 

Once the .deb package is created, we just install it as root as if it was a normal debian package. 

	:::console
	dpkg -i oracle-j2sdk1.7_1.7.0+update45_amd64.deb

Check that everything went ok:

	:::console
	javac -version

You should get a message stating your javac version is 1.6.

Finally we add some variables to /etc/profile so libertya can know where to find Java and itself. 

	:::console
	export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/j2sdk1.6-oracle/
	export OXP_HOME=/ServidorOXP



ServidorOXP and DB dump
--------------------

We need to download both from [Libertya's website](http://www.libertya.org/producto/descargas/libertya-1402).
Once we have them, we just unzip them 

	:::console
	unzip dump_libertya_1402ar.sql.zip
	unzip ServidorOXP_V14.02.zip
	mv ServidorOXP /ServidorOXP
	cd /ServidorOXP
	chmod 足R +x *.sh

Once this is done, we need to create Libertya's DB. for that we execute the following SQL as postgres user (`psql 足-U postgres`):

	:::postgres
	CREATE ROLE libertya LOGIN ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'md52b2861c4d594f29f9ce9107c4560f3ae' SUPERUSER CREATEDB CREATEROLE VALID UNTIL 'infinity' IN ROLE postgres; UPDATE pg_authid SET rolcatupdate=true WHERE rolname='libertya';

then we create the language:

	:::console
	createlang 足-U postgres 足-d template1 plpgsql

and finally the DB

	:::postgres
	CREATE DATABASE libertya WITH ENCODING='UTF8' OWNER=libertya;

once everything is done, we just use the dump to populate the DB. 

	:::console
	psql -U libertya -d libertya -f dump_libertya_1402ar.sql


If all went OK. We follow to the Libertya's configuration. 
As we are in a remote VM, we do not have an X11 enviroment, so we cannot use the Configurar.sh script in /ServidorOXP. We will need to manually edit LibertyaEnv.properties. For that we copy the template:

	:::console
	cd /ServidorOXP
	cp LibertyaEnvTemplate.properties LibertyaEnv.properties
	nano LibertyaEnv.properties

inside this file you will find Libertya's configuration settings. I will edit only the path related settings, as my main goal is to get it running for testing purposes. 

	:::console
	DEPLOY_APPS_OXP=/ServidorOXP/jboss/server/openXpertya/deploy
	KEYSTORE_OXP=/ServidorOXP/keystore/myKeystore
	JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/j2sdk1.6-oracle

Once the paths were corrected, we run ConfigurarAuto.sh

	:::console
	./ConfigurarAuto.sh

This will configure libertya's based on the file we have just edited. 

As a last step, we copy the init.d script from libertya so we can manage the service. 

	:::console
	cp /ServidorOXP/utils/unix/libertyad_ubuntu-debian.sh /etc/init.d/libertyad
	chmod +x /etc/init.d/libertyad
	update-rc.d libertyad defaults
	service libertyad start

And that's it! we should have a working libertya's on our Digital Ocean Debian VM.
